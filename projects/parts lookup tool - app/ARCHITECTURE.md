# Architecture — Parts Lookup Tool

## Data Flow

```
[ODBC: InMaster] → df_InMaster_PartsLookup_Raw → InMaster_PartsLookup_Raw (Lakehouse)
                                                          │
                                                          ▼
                                          Sync step (mechanism: see Task 4/5 findings)
                                                          │
                                                          ▼
                                    PartLocation table (Fabric App's own SQL Database in Fabric)
                                                          │
                                                          ▼
                                          parts-lookup-app (Fabric App, GraphQL + React UI)
```

## Key Constraints

- Do NOT modify the existing `InMaster.pq` / `InMaster_Raw.pq` raw pulls — this is a separate, purpose-built table for this tool only.
- BinQty is computed at the raw-query level (`ON_HAND_QTY - Pending_Qty`), not in the Fabric App — validated 2026-07-15 at 99.94% exact match against `jdis_Part_Information`'s independently tracked BinQty (1,102,498 / 1,103,165 rows).
- The Fabric App (generic Rayfin template) cannot read the Lakehouse directly — it owns its own schema. Data must be pushed in via the sync step.

## Sync Mechanism

Filled in after Task 4 (discovery) — will be one of:
- Direct SQL write (Dataflow Gen2 or notebook connecting straight to the SQL Database in Fabric's connection string), or
- GraphQL mutations via the Rayfin client from a notebook

## Refresh Cadence

Not yet fixed — see Task 6. Not capped by `jdis_Part_Information`'s 3x/day schedule since this table no longer depends on it; bounded only by how often you want to re-sync.
